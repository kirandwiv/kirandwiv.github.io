<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
<p>In my toddler days I was both fascinated and dumbfounded by economics. Since then, after considerable toil and effort, I have grown to be more dumbfounded and less fascinated. <br> 
    Below are two pictures of my younger self at varying stages of dumbfoundedness</p>
