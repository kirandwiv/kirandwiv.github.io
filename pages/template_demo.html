        <h2><div>Collaborative Innovation</div></h2>
        <p>Much of the software we use today is built on "open source" code. That is, code that is free and, theoretically, accessible to all. 
          Machine learning libraries such as 
          pytorch and tensorflow, web frameworks like Django and Flask, and even the Linux operating system are all 
          examples of open-source software. Tensorflow is a particularly interesting case as it is formally 
          supported by Google, breaking with the tradition of open-source code being developed by a community of independent programmers.

          The economics of open-source software warrant further investigation. Why is it possible and profitable for companies like Google
          to deploy considerable resources in the development of software they later distribute freely? Below we will explore some possible explanations 
          and motivations for the development of open-source software and the collaborative innovation it engenders.

          <h3>A Simple Model</h3>

          In the simplest model, we have a single firm that produces two goods \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Consumers each have a value for each good. The distribution of values for good one are drawn from 
          \(v \sim F_1(\theta_1)\). The distribution of values for good two depend on the quantity of good 1 sold: \(F_2(\theta_2|x_1)\). The firm can observe the distribution of values for both goods. Consumers purchase
          the good if \(v \geq p\). The relative sizes of the markets are determined by the parameter \(\lambda \in [0,1]\). The firm sets prices for both goods. The firm's objective is to maximize profit:

          \[ \max_{p_1,p_2}  \lambda (p_1 -c_1) F(p_1) + (1-\lambda)(p_2-c_2)F(p_2|\lambda F(p_1)) \]

          The problem yields the following equilibrium conditions:

          \begin{align*}
            \lambda \left[F_1(p_1)+\frac{\partial F_1(p_1)}{\partial dp_1}(p_1-c_1)\right] + (1-\lambda)(p_2-c_2)\frac{\partial F_2(p_2|\lambda F(p_1))}{\partial F(p_1)}\lambda \frac{\partial F(p_1)}{\partial dp_1} &= 0\\
            (1-\lambda)\left[p_2 F_2(p_2|\lambda F(p_1)) + \frac{\partial F_2(p_2|\lambda F(p_1))}{\partial dp_2}(p_2-c_2)\right] &= 0
          \end{align*}
