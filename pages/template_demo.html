        <p>Much of the software we use today is built on "open source" code. That is, code that is free and, theoretically, accessible to all. 
          Machine learning libraries such as 
          pytorch and tensorflow, web frameworks like Django and Flask, and even the Linux operating system are all 
          examples of open-source software. Tensorflow is a particularly interesting case as it is formally 
          supported by Google, breaking with the tradition of open-source code being developed by a community of independent programmers.

          The economics of open-source software warrant further investigation. Why is it possible and profitable for companies like Google
          to deploy considerable resources in the development of software they later distribute freely? Below we will explore some possible explanations 
          and motivations for the development of open-source software and the collaborative innovation it engenders.
