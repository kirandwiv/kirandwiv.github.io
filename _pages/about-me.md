"Kiran Dwivedi is a Pre-Doc RA with the Microsoft Economics and Computation Team. Kiran earned his BA
in Economics & History at the University of Oxford and his MA in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics at Columbia University. Kiranâ€™s research interests lie in the fields of Industrial Organization (in particular the Economics of Innovation) and Computational Economics. To date, he has also never turned down the opportunity to discuss either Economic History or the History of Economics (and, to the chagrin of many of his friends, has occasionally fabricated such opportunities).

Kiran doesn't always talk about himself in the third-person."
