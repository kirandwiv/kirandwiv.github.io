Welcome to my website! Here I sometimes explore what Thomas Carlyle called a "a dreary, desolate and, indeed, quite abject and distressing" science. Because it has its moments. Please take everything I've written on here very seriously.

Also, in a bid to avoid the [Preface Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preface_paradox) please note that any errors you might encounter on this website are entirely my sister's doing.
