### Introduction
The early stages of the COVID pandemic brought out the best in humanity. Who can forget those heroes who valiantly sacrificed others in  defending our personal freedoms by refusing to wear masks? Academics too rose to the occasion. Luminaries helpfully explained why certain countries were better behaved under lockdowns: East-Asian countries were simply more obedient, you see. More socially-minded. And the decadent west was just too individualistic for quarantines and curfews to be observed. Finally, there were the hoarders. Those who rushed to the supermarket and bought all the toilet paper they could lay their hands on. Exemplary social behaviour and a testament to just how far humanity has come in conquering its baser instincts. There was a time when those same people would have simply gone without wiping. 

Governments too competed in a less than amicable fashion in procuring the equipment needed to fight the pandemic. US government agents reportedly ran onto a runway and "waved wads of cash" at Chinese airport staff, successfully "wrest[ing] control of a consignment of masks as it was about to be dispatched to France". Then there was the petty squabbling and bickering between EU states and the UK over vaccine shipments. Indeed government devised all sorts of plans, some cunning and others stupid, in their bid to secure scarce resources. The outcomes of their efforts ranged from the absurdly awful (see the UK's procurement of PPE) to the awesomely successful (see the UK's procurement of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine). 

In fact, I'd argue governments' procurement programs were the single most important element their pandemic responses. They dictated the resources pushed into vaccine development, who got these vaccines first and at what cost. They also helped healthcare providers get the equipment they needed until then. 

It might, then, be worth thinking about how governments assign these significant contracts. What does a good procurement policy look like? What does a bad procurement policy look like?
