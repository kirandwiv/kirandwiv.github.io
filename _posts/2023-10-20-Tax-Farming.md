title:  "Tax Farming: should we bring it back?"
---

To the unininitiated "tax farming" might sound like an awful idea. Why grow more taxes for yourself? But ask yourself: if taxes take from the worker the hard-earned fruits of his labour, what happens when those fruit are taxes?

Fortunately we needn't concern ourselves with this troubling thought any further. As it turns out, tax farming has little to do with cows and agriculture. Instead, it is the name given to a formerly prevalent form of tax collection. Today, we have the IRS, but tax collection hasn't always been this centralized or efficient(??). Instead, historically, rulers and governments often auctioned the right to levy a specific tax to private citizens! These citizens would, in theory, bid what they expected to be able to earn by obtaining this concession. They were then responsible for the collection and accounting process. 

You might be wondering why on earth a ruler would choose to do this.
