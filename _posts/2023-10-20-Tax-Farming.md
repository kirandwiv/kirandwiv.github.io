title:  "Tax Farming: should we bring it back?"
---

To the unininitiated "tax farming" might sound like a poor idea. Why grow more taxes for yourself? But ask yourself: if taxes take from the worker the hard-earned fruits of their labour, what happens when those fruit are taxes?

As it turns out, that tax farming has little to do with trees and agriculture. Instead, it is the name given to a formerly prevalent form of tax-collection. Today, we have the IRS to collect our taxes but tax collection hasn't always been this centralized or efficient(??). Instead, historically, rulers and governments auctioned the right to levy a specific tax to private citizens! These citizens would, in theory, bid what they expected to be able to earn by obtaining this concession. 

You might be wondering why on earth a ruler would choose to do this.
