title:  "Tax Farming: should we bring it back?"
---

To the unininitiated "tax farming" might sound like an awful idea. Why grow more taxes for yourself? But ask yourself: if taxes take from the worker the hard-earned fruits of his labour, what happens when those fruit are taxes?

Fortunately we needn't concern ourselves with this troubling thought any further. As it turns out, tax farming has little to do with fruit and agriculture. Instead, it is the name given to a once prevalent form of tax collection. Today we have the IRS, but tax collection hasn't always been this centralized or efficient(??). Instead, historically, rulers and governments often auctioned the right to levy a specific tax to private citizens! These citizens would, in theory, bid what they expected to be able to earn by obtaining this concession. They were then responsible for the collection and accounting processes. 

You might be wondering why on earth a ruler would choose to do this. Why not just hire some thugs, instruct them to sally forth in pursuit of taxes and unleash them on their hapless subjects? Well, our ancestors (or, if like me your family doesn't have its own coat of arms, more likely their overlords) had good economic reasons for delegating tax collection in this fashion. 

To understand these, it's worth taking a little detour via Contract Theory. Though Contract Theory may be second only to "tax farming" in the list of least interestingly named things on this post, it turns out it's actually pretty interesting. Consider a model in which a "Princple" (in our case the ruler) seeks to delegate a task to an "Agent" (in our case the tax collector/thug). Consider first a baseline in which the principle observes whether the "effort/honesty" put into the task by the agent is High or Low. The expected profit (tax collected) depends on this effort level such that:

\begin{align*}
E[\pi|e=H] = P(S|e=H)\pi(S) + P(F|e=H)\pi(F) \cdot > P(S|e=L)\pi(S)+P(F|e=L)\pi(F)= E[\pi|e=L]
\end{align*}

That is, our ruler can observe exactly how honestly and efficiently his tax agents are working. Further, assume the agent has a "reservation wage" of $10 (think of this as an outside option for the tax collector/thug, like joining the Ballet). What wage will the Principle offer? We can solve for it below.
